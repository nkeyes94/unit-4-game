Crystal Collector

-Rules:
    -The game should start with a random number between 19-120
        -This is the score in which the player should match
    -The game should have 3 crystals with random values from 1-12
        -These values will be hidden

-Code:
    -Import other files to index.html
    -If JQuery is to be used, that needs to be imported as well

    -Create a box to house the first random number which the player needs to guess to
    -Create a second box to record the players' guesses
    -Create 3 buttons with the second random numbers attached (1-12)
        -Hide the value of the buttons from the player
    
    -In order to make the random numbers:
        - Math.floor(Math.random(19-120) + 1)
            -This should be used for the first random number
        -Math.floor(Math.random(1-12) + 1)
            -This should be used for the second random number
            -We will need to create 3 random numbers for the buttons
        -Functions can be used in order to make these numbers

    -Once the numbers are created:
        -The first random number should be displayed in the first box created
        -Dom manipulation can be used here
            -The random number should take over the html property inside of the box
                -JQuery
                    -$("#boxOne).text(randomNumberFunction());
                -JS
                    -document.getelementbyid("boxOne").... etc.
            -The user guess should be recorded in the second box
                -Guesses: g1, g2, g3...gx
                -Record guesses: guessTotal
                -guessTotal = guessTotal + gx
                -Display the guessTotal
                -JQuery
                    -$("#boxTwo).text(guessTotal);
                -JS
                    -document.getelementbyid("boxTwo).... etc.
    -Implementing game logic:
        -The var guessTotal must be compared to the target (first random number)
        -If the guessTotal > the target, the game ends. No points issued, the game resets.
        -If guessTotal < target, the player must continue until another condition is met
        -If guessTotal = target, the player receives a point. The game resets.
        -There should be several vars to record progress
            -Wins
            -Losses
        -These vars can be displayed on the page as well.
