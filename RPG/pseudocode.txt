-Objective: Create a game that allows for text based combat
-Create:
    -Characters (As objects)
        -Objects:
            -Health, experience, stamina, weapon
    
-Have 2 different characters fight
    -Health should be adjusted by the weapon damage
    -Experience should be adjusted per character defeated
    -Stamina will be adjusted during combat periods
    -Weapon:
        -Allow for different weapons to be in the game with different damages
    
-Start with the player selecting a character, or defining their own
-After a character is made, have them fight an opponent to increase experience and unlock other fights
-There should be a loop for combat
    -While(player.health > 0 || enemy.health > 0){
        combat
    }

-Combat should be diverse
    -Now I am getting too ahead of myself.
